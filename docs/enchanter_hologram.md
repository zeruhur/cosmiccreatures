### Enchanter Hologram
6 HP, 2 Armor, 3 STR, 4 DEX, 6 WIL, Light Manipulation

- A humanoid figure composed of pure holographic light. Can create illusory duplicates of itself and manipulate light to form powerful energy beams.
- The holographic nature of this entity enables it to craft intricate illusions that deceive and beguile foes, often diverting attention away from its true intentions.
- When critically damaged, the enchanter hologram harnesses its mastery over light to emit a blinding burst of radiant energy, momentarily disorienting and dazzling enemies. This burst of energy also enhances its illusionary abilities, making its duplicates even more convincing and bewildering.
