- A gaseous creature that hovers in the air. Can control gas molecules and create explosions of chaotic energy.
- Its ethereal nature and control over gases make it an elusive and unpredictable adversary.
- When critically damaged, releases a burst of chaotic energy that destabilizes the surrounding atmosphere, causing sudden and violent gas eruptions that can disorient enemies and deal additional damage, while also using the chaos to reconfigure its gaseous form and enhance its maneuverability.
