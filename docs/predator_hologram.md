- Its ability to transition from a holographic state to a physical form grants it the advantage of both versatility and brute strength.
- When critically damaged, undergoes a surge of stamina, enabling it to briefly enhance its physical form, increasing its strength and speed, and channeling this energy into powerful ranged energy attacks, while also using the enhanced physicality to engage in close combat with increased effectiveness.
