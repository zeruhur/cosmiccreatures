- A form of artificial intelligence that exists solely in holographic form. Can create illusory holograms, manipulate the environment, and interact with technological devices.
- Its ability to project illusions and alter its surroundings using holographic projections makes it a versatile and perplexing opponent.
- When critically damaged, projects a cascade of holographic anomalies, creating a chaotic field of illusory distractions that disorient enemies and obscure their vision, while also using the energy from the anomalies to reinforce its own holographic presence.
