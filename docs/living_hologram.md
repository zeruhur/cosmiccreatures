### Living Hologram
6 HP, 2 Armor, 3 STR, 4 DEX, 6 WIL, Light Manipulation

- A creature formed from pure holographic light. Can manipulate light, create illusory duplicates of itself, and attack with concentrated beams of light.
- Its nature as a living projection grants it the ability to deceive and distract enemies, making it a challenging adversary to predict and engage.
- When critically damaged, harnesses the chaotic instability of its holographic structure, unleashing a blinding burst of light that disorients and temporarily blinds foes, while simultaneously reshaping its own form to enhance its defenses and mobility, making it even more elusive and difficult to target.
